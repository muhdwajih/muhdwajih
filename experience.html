      <h5 class="w3-center">ON 2019</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Mobile Legend Bang Bang is a free online battle arena (MOBA), which has a wide range of heroes, rapid matchmaking and fast-running fighting to enable quick gameplay sessions on the go. It contains much that a PC MOBA such as League of League of Legends or SMITE would expect from players, which includes laning, jungling, object construction, roles as heroes, skin and many more. Its touchpad controls make the game on tablets and phones seamless, with some personalizable options that add self-service, final touches, and more to help control the game easily. I was the champion in 2019 in the Black Box Penang Mobile Legend Tournament. After three months of training, my teams were performing very well. Every night we train to ensure that we win these tournaments. Thanks to all your family and friends who will always help us. We were awarded the best team at Pulau Pinang in Mobile Legends as a leader happy with my performance as a team leader. The award we won is RM2000 and headphone razer. I hope that for our next tournament our team will improve our skills more and more.

        <h1 class="w3-center">CHAMPION PUBG MOBILE TOURNAMENT</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-center">SINCE 2020</h5>
        <p class="w3-large"> PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online royal battle game that is developed and published by the South Korean video game company Bluehole, PUBG Corporation. The game is based on the previous mods created for other sports by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, inspired by Battle Royale in 2000 and expanded under the creative direction of Greene into a standalone game. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute on the island to kill other people while avoiding killing themselves for weapons and equipment. In 2020, I was the Champion of the Penang Pubg Mobile Tournament that held at Inti Collage. My teams performed very well after four months of training. We train each night to make sure those tournaments are won. Thank you to all your family and friends who will help and sustain us all the time. With my team, I'm glad. I can achieve this award without them as the tournament's Most Killed Player. The RM3000 award we received. I hope our team will improve our skills to another level in our next tournament, namely Pubg Mobile Pro League (PMPL)</p>

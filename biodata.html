        <p><strong>ASSALAMUALAIKUM! </strong>First, I would like to tell you that this is my first experience in creating my own website. I hope you can enjoy my work and also gain something from my website before you continue to explore my website. My name is Muhammad Wajih Bin Mohd Noor, I'm 21. I am currently a student in the Department of Diploma Information Management at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Kedah and this year is my most recent semester at (UiTM) Kedah Branch. I'm living in Penang, Bukit Mertajam, and it's my first time staying at Kedah. What can I say? It takes 1 hour from my hometown to Kedah and I'm glad to stay here to study.
          Besides, I have many things and goals in my life that I want to achieve and marry too. I can describe my life as workaholic and simple, where I filled my friends most of the day and worked for my own business and my own family. I worked as a marketing person in my dad's food business, before I continued my studies. This is my new journey through life which will bring me a diploma in information management. I am glad to be one of the students from (UiTM) Kedah Branch.
           Last but not least I am a lot familiar with the way I create a web site, for instance, I can learn how to use adobe software in the right way. This is such a good experience that during my study here I can also gain more knowledge.

        <p>EXCIDENT IN THE HIGHWAY</p>
        <p>
          On 7th January 2017, I've had a Y15ZR motorcycle accident, which is things I'm never going to forget. I'm heading for my club rider to meet with the Seberang Jaya. I was involved in an accident during my journey. On the highway, I was driven over by a car to the meeting. I was injured in my face and arms because of this accident, but nothing was too serious. My motorcycle has serious damage as a result of this accident. Many passers-by stopped during the accident and came to watch this accident. I was picked up and taken to the hospital by an ambulance.
